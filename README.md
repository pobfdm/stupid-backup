# Stupid Backup
A simple and almost stupid windows application to do incremental backups
of your data.

Put the executable (stupid-backup.exe) in the folder (or flash drive, or
hard disk) where the backups should be stored,double click on it and 
... done!

You can also manage your exclusions on exclusions.txt files generated at
the first start by following the syntax of rsync.
